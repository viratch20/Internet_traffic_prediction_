# Internet_traffic_prediction_
The goal is to predict internet traffic using a time-series forecasting technique to optimize resource allocation. Many real-world organizations, such as e-commerce retailers like Amazon, Ebay, and others, use such applications to predict and monitor internet traffic. You can forecast the Internet traffic in this project using time-series models as ARIMA and Holt-Winters. This project involves comparing the performance of the time-series prediction models designed of different approaches.
